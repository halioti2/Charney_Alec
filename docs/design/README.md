# Design References

| Track | Artifact | Location |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Track A – PDF Audit | Verification modal (two-panel), confidence badge states, compliance checklist screenshots | _Add Figma link or PNG export here_ |
| Track B – Payments | Payout queue table, confirmation modal, history badge examples | _Add Figma link or PNG export here_ |
| Track C – Commission Viz | Broker dashboard layout, agent detail drill-down, stalled-deal indicators | _Add Figma link or PNG export here_ |

Please update this README with actual Figma URLs or exported assets so LLM prompts can reference consistent visuals. Save static screenshots as PNG in this folder (e.g., `/docs/design/pdf-modal.png`).
